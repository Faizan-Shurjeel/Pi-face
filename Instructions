Of course. This is the final and most exciting step. Here is a complete, step-by-step guide with the exact  commands to set up your project from scratch on your Raspberry Pi.

Since you don't have SSH or VNC, you will be typing these commands directly into the Terminal application on your Raspberry Pi's desktop.

Prerequisites

A Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspberry Pi OS (with Desktop) installed and updated.

A keyboard, mouse, and monitor connected to the Pi.

An internet connection on the Pi.

A USB drive for transferring files (Method A) OR a GitHub account (Method B).

Phase 1: Prepare the Project Directory and Virtual Environment

Open the Terminal on your Raspberry Pi. These commands will create a dedicated folder for your project and a clean Python environment inside it.



# Go to your home directory
cd ~

# Create a new folder for your project
mkdir fyp_pi
cd fyp_pi

# Create a Python virtual environment named 'venv'
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment. You must do this every time you open a new terminal.
source venv/bin/activate

# Your terminal prompt should now start with (venv).
# This shows the virtual environment is active.
Phase 2: Install All Dependencies

First, we need to make sure the Pi's system has the necessary libraries for OpenCV to work correctly.



# Update the package list and install system-level dependencies for OpenCV
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libpng-dev

Now, with your (venv) still active, install the Python packages using pip. This is the most important part. We will install the special tflite-runtime instead of the full TensorFlow.



# Install the TFLite runtime, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and NumPy
pip install tflite-runtime
pip install opencv-python
pip install scikit-learn
pip install numpy

Your Raspberry Pi now has all the software it needs.

Phase 3: Transfer Your Project Files

You need to get your four essential project components onto the Pi:

enrollment_pro.py

authentication_pro.py

output_model.tflite

The entire face_detector folder.

Choose one of the following methods.

Method A: Using a USB Drive (Recommended for Simplicity)

On your Windows Laptop:

Plug in your USB drive.

Copy the four items listed above directly onto the USB drive.

Safely eject the USB drive.

On your Raspberry Pi:

Plug the USB drive into the Pi. It should auto-mount.

Open the Pi's File Manager and find your USB drive (usually listed on the left side). Note its name.

Now, in your Terminal (with the (venv) still active and inside the fyp_pi directory), run the following commands. Replace YOUR_USB_NAME with the actual name of your USB drive. The path is typically /media/pi/YOUR_USB_NAME.






# Copy the files from the USB to your current project directory
cp /media/pi/YOUR_USB_NAME/enrollment_pro.py .
cp /media/pi/YOUR_USB_NAME/authentication_pro.py .
cp /media/pi/YOUR_USB_NAME/output_model.tflite .

# Copy the entire face_detector folder recursively
cp -r /media/pi/YOUR_USB_NAME/face_detector .
Method B: Using GitHub (More Professional)

On your Windows Laptop:

Create a new, private repository on GitHub.

Upload your four project items (enrollment_pro.py, authentication_pro.py, output_model.tflite, and the face_detector folder) to this repository.

On your Raspberry Pi:

First, install Git on your Pi.






sudo apt-get install -y git
```    *   In your Terminal (with the `(venv)` active and inside the `fyp_pi` directory), clone the repository. **Replace `YOUR_REPO_URL`** with the URL from your GitHub repository.

```
# Clone the repository into the current directory
git clone YOUR_REPO_URL .

The . at the end tells Git to clone the contents into the current fyp_pi folder, not a new sub-folder.

Phase 4: Final Check and Run the Application

Your project is now fully set up on the Pi. Let's verify and run it.

Verify the file structure:

In your terminal (inside ~/fyp_pi), run the ls -R command. The output should look exactly like this:






(venv) pi@raspberrypi:~/fyp_pi $ ls -R

.:
authentication_pro.py  face_detector         output_model.tflite
enrollment_pro.py      venv

./face_detector:
deploy.prototxt  res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel

./venv:
# (many files and folders for the virtual environment)

Run the Enrollment App:

Make sure your (venv) is active. If not, run source venv/bin/activate.

Run the enrollment script to create a new face_database.npy on the Pi.



python enrollment_pro.py

Follow the on-screen instructions and your terminal prompts to enroll a face.

Run the Authentication App:

After enrolling, run the authentication script.



python authentication_pro.py

The webcam window should appear, and your efficient, interval-based face authentication system will now be running entirely on your Raspberry Pi. Congratulations
